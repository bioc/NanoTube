\usage{
groupFGSEA(
  gsea.res,
  l.edge,
  join.threshold = NULL,
  ngroups = NULL,
  dist.method = "binary",
  returns = c("signif", "all")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gsea.res}{Results from pathway analysis for a single comparison, using limmaToFSEA.}

\item{l.edge}{Leading edge result from fgseaToLEdge.}

\item{join.threshold}{The threshold distance to join gene sets. Gene sets with a distance
below this value will be joined to a single "cluster."}

\item{ngroups}{The desired number of gene set groups. Either 
'join.threshold' or 'ngroups' must be specified, 'ngroups' takes priority 
if both are specified.}

\item{dist.method}{Method for distance calculation (see options for dist()).
We recommend the 'binary' (also known as Jaccard) distance.}

\item{returns}{Either "signif" or "all". This argument defines whether only significantly
enriched gene sets are included in the output table, or if the full results are included.
Regardless of this selection, only significantly enriched gene sets are clustered.}
}
\value{
A data frame including the FGSEA results, plus two additional columns for the clustering
results:

\item{Cluster}{The cluster that the gene set was assigned to. Gene sets in the same
cluster have a distance below the join.threshold.}

\item{best}{Whether the gene set is the most enriched (by p-value) in a given cluster.}
}
\description{
Groups the pathway analysis results (using limmaToFGSEA or nsdiffToFGSEA) based on
the enriched gene sets' leading edges. If the calculated distance metric is lower than
the given threshold (i.e. the gene sets have highly overlapping leading edge genes),
these gene sets will be joined to a single gene set "cluster."
}
\examples{
data("ExamplePathways")
data("ExampleResults") # Results from runLimmaAnalysis

fgseaResults <- limmaToFGSEA(ExampleResults, gene.sets = ExamplePathways)

leadingEdge <- fgseaToLEdge(fgseaResults, cutoff.type = "padj", cutoff = 0.1)

Group the results, and only returns those satisfying the cutoff specified in leadingEdge()
groupedResults <- groupFGSEA(fgseaResults, leadingEdge,
                             join.threshold = 0.5,
                             returns = "signif")
}
