\title{Run gene set enrichment analysis using DE results.}
\usage{
limmaToFGSEA(
  limmaResults,
  gene.sets,
  sourceDB = NULL,
  min.set = 1,
  rank.by = c("coefficients", "t"),
  skip.first = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{limmaResults}{Result from runLimmaAnalysis.}

\item{gene.sets}{Gene set file name, in .rds (list), .gmt, or .tab format;
or a list object containing the gene sets. Gene names must be
in the same form as in the ranked.list.}

\item{sourceDB}{Source database to include (only if using a .tab-format 
geneset.file from CPDB).}

\item{min.set}{Number of genes required to conduct analysis on a given gene 
set (default = 1). If fewer than this number of genes from limmaResults are 
included in a gene set, that gene set will be skipped for this analysis.}

\item{rank.by}{Rank genes by log2 fold changes ('coefficients', default) or 
t-statistics ('t').}

\item{skip.first}{Logical: Skip the first factor for gene set analysis?
Frequently the first factor is the 'Intercept', which is generally 
uninteresting for GSEA (default TRUE).}
}
\value{
A list containing data frames with the fgsea results for each 
comparison.
}
\description{
Use the fgsea library to run gene set enrichment analysis from the Limma
analysis results. Genes will be ranked by their log2 fold changes
or t-statistics.
}
\examples{
data("ExamplePathways")
data("ExampleResults") # Results from runLimmaAnalysis

# Use the default settings
fgseaResults <- limmaToFGSEA(ExampleResults, gene.sets = ExamplePathways)

# Only include gene sets with at least 5 genes in the NanoString data set,
# and rank genes by their "t" statistics.
fgseaResults <- limmaToFGSEA(ExampleResults, gene.sets = ExamplePathways,
                             min.set = 5, rank.by = "t")
}
